\hypertarget{impact}{%
\subsection{Impact}\label{impact}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  High - leads to a loss of a significant portion (\textgreater10\%) of
  assets in the protocol, or significant harm to a majority of users.
\item
  Medium - global losses \textless10\% or losses to only a subset of
  users, but still unacceptable.
\item
  Low - losses will be annoying but bearable-\/-applies to things like
  griefing attacks that can be easily repaired or even gas
  inefficiencies.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{likelihood}{%
\subsection{Likelihood}\label{likelihood}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  High - almost certain to happen, easy to perform, or not easy but
  highly incentivized
\item
  Medium - only conditionally possible or incentivized, but still
  relatively likely
\item
  Low - requires stars to align, or little-to-no incentive
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Action required for severity
levels}\label{action-required-for-severity-levels}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Critical - Must fix as soon as possible (if already deployed)
\item
  High - Must fix (before deployment if not already deployed)
\item
  Medium - Should fix
\item
  Low - Could fix
\end{itemize}
